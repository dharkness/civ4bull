Optional Assets
---------------

This folder contains the assets for mods and features that are optional in BULL.
Each one has a readme detailing the compiler flag you need to define in your makefile
to enable the feature and how to merge in the files to your Assets folder.

Merging Files
-------------

Each file in the readmes has a letter code next to it telling you how to merge it
into your Assets folder.

A - Added file

  Add this new file.

R - Replaced file

  Replace the same file with the one here.

M - Modified file

  Merge the marked changes into your file.

Where you have modified the files in BULL's Assets folder already, you will need to manually
merge in the changes here.
